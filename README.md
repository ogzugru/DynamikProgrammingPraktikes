# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method used in computer science and mathematics to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, solving each subproblem just once, and storing their solutions - ideally, in a memory-based data structure. The key principle behind dynamic programming is the optimization of recursion by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again, thereby reducing the computation time. This technique is particularly effective for problems that exhibit the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, meaning that the solution to the problem can be constructed efficiently from the solutions of its subparts.

For example, in the context of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, naive recursion would redundantly calculate the same values multiple times. However, by using dynamic programming, we can store the Fibonacci numbers that have already been calculated, thus avoiding the need for recalculation. This not only saves computational resources but also significantly speeds up the process. Dynamic programming can be applied in a variety of fields, including but not limited to, algorithm design, operations research, and economic planning, making it a versatile and powerful tool for solving complex problems.
